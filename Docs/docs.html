<h3>How to use it?</h3>
						<p>
							You'll need a few thing to use it. First of all the <a href="http://mootools.net/download" alt="Download MooTools 1.2.4">mootools Core library</a> and the <a href="http://mootools.net/more" alt="MooTools More 1.2.4.4 Builder">Fx.Sort</a> part of the moootools More Library.
							both files are included in the download, along with the mooltiSelect file.<br />
							you need to include the 3 files in betweend the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; of your html code. and don't forget the style sheet.<br />
							then jsut add to your domready event, the call to mooltiSelect, something like:
						</p>						
						<pre>
	window.addEvent('domready', function(){
		new mooltiselect();
						</pre>
						<h3>Which Properties you can pass to mooltiSelect, and which are the default values?</h3>
						<span>This are the available options:</span>
						<pre>
	list: 'list',
	options: 'option',
	selectedClass: 'selected',
	name: 'listBox',
	sort: false,
	drag: true,
	maximum: 0,
	errorMessage: 'You already selected the maximum of %MAX% items'	
						</pre>
						<p>
							<b>list</b>, is the id of the container element, default value is list.<br />
							<b>options</b>, is the class of the elements you want to convert to a multiselect, defaults to option.<br />
							<b>selectedClass</b>, is the class mooltiSelect gives to the selected items, so the user can know which options (s)he selected, default selected.<br />
							<b>name</b>, is the name that will assign to the input elements, that will be send in the form, defaults to listBox.<br />
							<b>sort</b>, it's a boolean, and enables/disables the ability to sort the options, defaults to false.<br />

							<b>maximum</b>, it's the limit of options the user can select, 0 means no limit and it's also de default value.
							<b>errorMessage</b> The error message displayed when the maximum options are selected, it accept a %MAX% wildcard, that will be replaced with the number of options. defaults to 'You already selected the maximum of %MAX% items'
						</p>
						<h3>is there any special markup I need to know?</h3>
						<p>
							Yes there is, it's not a big thing, bur you need to place a rel attribute in your option elements, that's where mooltiSelect gets the value for each option.
						</p>
						<h3>Why if I select sortables, the options are not selected?</h3>
						<p>
							In oreder to select any option, while sortable enable, you need to doubleclick, sin the click event, is associated with the sorting.
